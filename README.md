# sas-development
A repo showcasing all my sas development work. It has various commands, functions, formats to cover all basics of using the sas studio for analytics.

SAS allows us to generate code, use predefined tasks or build custom tasks to access, join, filter, sort, prepare and analyze data prior to building and deploying models. It lets us easily access programs, data files, tables and libraries from a single, customizable interface.

1. dataset_operations.sas - This script utlizes the library datasts pre-defined in the sas library as well as creatiion and manupilation of user-defined datasets. Operators like 'where', 'like', '%', 'noobs', 'nods' are used to subset datsets and see the functions that it performs on the said datasets.
