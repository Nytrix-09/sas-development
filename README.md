# sas-development
A repo showcasing my SAS journey and development work. It has various commands, functions, formats to cover all basics of using the sas studio for analytics. This is my road to becoming a SAS Base Certified Professional.

SAS allows us to generate code, use predefined tasks or build custom tasks to access, join, filter, sort, prepare and analyze data prior to building and deploying models. It lets us easily access programs, data files, tables and libraries from a single, customizable interface.

1. dataset_operations.sas - This script utlizes the library datasts pre-defined in the sas library as well as creatiion and manupilation of user-defined datasets. Operators like 'where', 'like', '%', 'noobs', 'nods' are used to subset datsets and see the functions that it performs on the said datasets.
2. nb2.sas - This notebook encompasses dataset creation and subsetting data from said dataset using information like salary, country etc. It also incorporates grouping data in ascending/descending order within countries defined in the dataset. Giving titles and footnotes to datasets is also observed.
3. formatting_1.sas - This script encompasses formatting operations like date, month, year and creating tiers and class bifurcation for salary variable to sort employees by dataset as well as experimenting with display options in individual columns.
